# timeMultiplexingSSDU
Time Multiplexing a seven-segment display unit (SSDU) - Nexys 3, Time division multiplexing (TDM) can serve as an effective way to drive multiple displays with limited pins. Since the Nexys 3 board has limited output pins, one can't connect each individual segment of all four displays directly. This is where TDM comes in handy. By rapidly switching between displaying each digit of the ALU output on the same set of segments, one can share the hardware resources between all four displays. This reduces the number of pins required compared to connecting each segment individually. TDM ultimately allows us to use fewer FPGA pins, making the design more cost-effective. This is important, especially for resource-constrained systems.
Note that the Nexys 3 board uses a 100 MHz crystal oscillator, for which the time period of once clock cycle is 10-8 s. The FPGA pin connected to the oscillator is V10; we need to connect this pin to the clk input of our module.
In order to multiplex each SSDU, we need to refresh it in time range of 1-4 ms. Assuming we take 4ms to refresh each SSDU after 4ms, all we need in Verilog is a counter that can count up to 4 * 10-3 /10-8 = 400,000 cycles. To count till 400,000, the counter must have ceil (log2 (400, 00)) bits. We can create a small counter (named digit counter) that counts from 0-3 to keep track of SSDU whose data is being currently displayed on the seven-segment unit.
